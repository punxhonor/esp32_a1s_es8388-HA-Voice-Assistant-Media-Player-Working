# esp32_a1s_es8388-HA-Voice-Assistant-Media-Player-Working
I'm very new to all this, but this is my attempt at having a working Voice Assistant satellite with OpenWakeWord as well as media player ability.
The specific board is this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B63KZ6C1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title
There are some slight errors, I am hoping someone who knows more about this than I do can help fix that.
Apart from the errors in the logs, it works. Wake words work repeatedly, why I was struggling with before. And media player works, the only catch is using the media player turns off the wake word, so you have to pause the media player to use the wake word again.
Would love for someone smarter than me to take a look and see what could improve.
